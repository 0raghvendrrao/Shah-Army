Lengaburu(King Shan) Army Count
Horse : 100
Elephants : 50
Armoured Trucks : 10
Sling Guns : 5

Falicornia(Al Falcone) Army Count
Horse : 300
Elephants : 200
Armoured Trucks : 40
Sling Guns : 20

Al Falcone has a larger army than King Shan. But she cannot leave her home planet unprotected. So she will always deploy a sub set of her army. Moreover King Shan’s army unit is 2X more stronger than Al Falcone’s.
If Falicornia attacks Lengaburu with 2 Horses, 2 Elephants, 2 Armoured Tanks and 2 Sling Guns, Lengaburu will win the war if King Shan matches the attack with 1 Horse, 1 Elephant, 1 Armoured Tank and 1 Sling Gun.
But not so fast! Al Falcone will surely attack with a larger army. Your coding challenge is to identify what battalions, and how many units of each battalion King Shan should deploy to match Al Falcone's attack.

the rules of war
Rule #1. The Power Rule: Each Lengaburu army unit is 2X more powerful than their Falcornia counterpart. Example: 1 Lengaburu Horse can counter 2 Falicornia Horses, 1 Lengaburu Elephant can counter 2 Falicornia Elephants and so on.

Rule #2. The Like-to-Like Rule:   Falicornia Horses battalion should be countered with Lengaburu horses battalion, Elephants with elephants and so on. Except when the battalion is completely exhausted (see Rule #3).

Example: If Falicornia deploys 2 H, 4 E, 0 AT and 6 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 1 H, 2 E, 0 AT and 3 SG.
Lengaburu’s army has 100 Horses, 50 Elephants, 10 Armoured Tanks and 5 Sling Guns

Rule #3. The Substitution Rule: When all units of a particular Lengaburu battalion is exhausted, an adjacent battalion can be used.  1 Elephant can replace 2 Horses (and 2 Horses can replace 1 Elephant), 1 Armoured Tank can replace 2 Elephants (and vice versa) and 1 Sling Gun can replace 2 Armoured Tanks (and vice versa). Note that only adjacent battalions can be used for substituting. Horses cannot replace Sling Guns as they are not adjacent.
Example: If Falicornia deploys 204 H, 20 E, 0 AT and 0 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 100 H, 11 E (1 Elephant has substituted 2 Horses which got exhausted at 100)
Example: If Falicornia deploys 0 H, 0 E, 14 AT and 12 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 0 H, 0 E, 9 AT and 5 SG (2 AT has substituted for 1 SG which got exhausted at 5)

Rule #4. The Substitution Choice Rule: When there are 2 possibilities of substitution, then always a lower ranked battalion should be used (Horses is lower than Elephants, is lower than Armoured Tanks, is lower than Sling Guns)
Example: If Falicornia deploys 50 H, 104 E, 6 AT and 2 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 29 H, 50 E, 3 AT and 1 SG (4 Horses substituted for 2 Elephants instead of the higher ranked Armoured Tanks)

Your program should take the location to the test ﬁle as parameter. Input needs to be read from a text ﬁle, and output should be printed to the console.

Input Format:FALICORNIA_ATTACK 100H 101E 20AT 5SG                               Output Format:WINS 52H 50E 10AT 3SG
H indicates the Horse battalion units,
E indicates the Elephant battalion units
AT indicates the Armoured Tank units
SG indicates the Sling Gun units of the Falicornia Army
WINS or LOSES indicate whether Lengaburu Army won the battle or not against Falicornia.
